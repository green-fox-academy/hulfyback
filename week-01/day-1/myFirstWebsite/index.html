            <h1 class="purple">Former deputy store manager</h1>
            <p>I used to be a deputy store manager. 
                There was always a lot to do, a lot of different tasks and a lot of pressure also. 
                But in a good environment surrounding with kind and hard worker colleagues, 
                the processing of the work was much smoother. </p>
            <p>I'm interested in computer science. I started this course at Green Fox Academy to became a data scientist.</p>

                <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; 
                    that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>
                
                <dt class="consolas">ASCII</dt>
                <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
                    Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical 
                    representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>
                
                <dt class="consolas">RAM</dt>
                <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions 
                    to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be 
                    read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location 
                    of data inside the memory.</dd>

                <dt class="consolas">Programming Language</dt>
                <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various 
                    kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to 
                    create programs that implement specific algorithms.</dd>
